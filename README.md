# Maze path finder
This is an implementation of A* searching algorithm to find path in the maze provided for the car to reach the destination by shortest path.

## Description 
A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.
The algorithm finds the optimal path. It is implemented in C++ language, taking advantage of its STL libraries.

## Requirements 
For the program compiler required is g++ compiler.

## Getting Started 
To run the program type following within the terminal:

1. Clone 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/pr2tik1/maze-solver.git

```
2. Compile
```
g++ astar.cpp
```
3. Run for the output to show
```
./a.out

```
